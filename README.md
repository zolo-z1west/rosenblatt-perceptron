# **The perceptron and a perceiving and recognizing automation - Rosenblatt(1957)**
##--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rosenblatt through his paper on an artifical neuron or a perceptron paved the way for modern neural nets and foundational deep learning. 
His paper being self explainative and amazing is at the same time huge and time consuming. And what is better than to understand something through code? 
i have attached my own pdf of his paper with my highlights and important points which i took reference from, and explained the crust of the paper in the jupyter notebook attached.

Hope you like it.
